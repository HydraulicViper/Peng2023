# Quantification of the Whole root system conductance

Script used for Peng et al. 2023
## Methods

- CPlantBox to generate root system architecture
- a meta-model calibrated from 8000 run of GARNAR-MECHA to get hydraulic conductivities from root diameter (works on maize plant only)
- MARSHAL to get the marco-hydraulic parameters
